# tailwindcss-line-clamp-no-ellipsis

This tailwind plugin is inspired by [tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-line-clamp](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-line-clamp/tree/master). Most of the time, we want to clamp the text with specific number of lines, and adding an ellipsis `...` at the end. But sometimes we just ONLY want to clipped the text WITHOUT ellipsis.
